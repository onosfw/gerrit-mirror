ONOS Deployment with Juju
=================================

This readme contains instructions for checking out and deploying Juju charms for
ONOS.

The charms are targetted at Trusty.

Checkout charms
---------------

Charms are hosted on Launchpad.
You need to 'sudo apt-get install bzr' first.

Follow these steps to checkout code:

cd <deployer dir>
./fetch-charms.sh

This will checkout the relevant charms into 'src' and create any Juju symlinks
in 'charms'.

Deploy with cloud-sh-onos
------------------------

cloud-sh-onos is a collection of development shell scripts to deploy
and setup OpenStack with ONOS using Juju's local provider. This will
create 3 KVMs as follows:

*KVM #1 - Keystone, Glance, Neutron Server, Nova Cloud Controller, Horizon,
          MySQL, RabbitMQ, ONOS Controller

*KVM #2 - Neutron agents

*KVM #3 - Nova Compute

You'll require approx. 13Gb RAM with 40Gb+ disk space.
Deployment can take anywhere between 20 mins to 1 hour.

You need to 'sudo apt-get install juju juju-local uvtool', and
logout/login in order to pick up libvirt group permissions before
proceeding. See https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju-core/+bug/1308088.

Follow these steps:

ssh-keygen
  (if you don't already have a key at ~/.ssh/id_rsa).

cp cloud-sh-onos/environments.yaml ~/.juju
  (or create your own default local environment in your existing
   environments.yaml file)

cd cloud-sh-onos

./deploy.sh

This will log to 'out.log'.

This will deploy OpenStack and import Trusty's daily image into Glance.

Horizon will be located on the machine 'juju status openstack-dashboard' -
http://<ip>/horizon.
Admin credentials will be written to cloud/admin-openrc.

The deployment can be destroyed with:

juju destroy-environment local


Deploy with Juju Deployer
-------------------------

Juju Deployer can deploy a preset configuration of charms given a yaml
configuration file. There is a configuration file in
'juju-deployer/onos.yaml'.

You need to 'sudo apt-get install juju-deployer' first.

Then:

cd juju-deployer

juju-deployer -c onos.yaml -d trusty-icehouse-onos

Juju Deployer will branch its own copy of the remote charms.
